    <p>
      In the following, we would like to inform you about the purposes, type and
      scope of the processing of your personal data while using the Contrasts
      App (hereinafter also referred to as the "App"). The legal basis for the
      level of data protection within the App is the Regulation (EU) 2016/679
      (GDPR).
    </p>
    <h2>1. Responsible body</h2>
    <p>Responsible for the processing of personal data within the app is:</p>
    <p>
      Christoph Wendt<br />
      Philippstra√üe 29<br />
      76185 Karlsruhe

    </p>
    <h2>2. Overview of the data processing within the app</h2>
    <p>
      The app allows you to create color pairs and determine their contrast to
      each other and thus the legibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using the app, the data processing that takes place can be divided
      into three main categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you download the app, the necessary information is transferred to
        the Apple App Store.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to enable functions of the app (e.g. splitting of created
        colour pairs), the app needs access to various functions of your mobile
        device (e.g. saving in picture gallery).
      </li>
      <li>
        In the course of using the App, various information is collected. This
        is pseudonymized data, for example, to create usage statistics or error
        reports in order to improve our app.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Installation of the Contrasts app</h2>
    <p>
      The Contrasts app is available through the App Store operated by Apple
      Inc. The download may require prior registration with the App Store and
      installation of the App Store software. We have no control over the
      collection and processing of your personal information in connection with
      registering and providing downloads from the App Store. Apple Inc. as the
      operator of the App Store is solely responsible in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information on this data processing, please refer to the App
      Store Privacy Policy:
    </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Use of our app</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Purposes of data processing / legal basis</h3>
    <p>The following data is collected when the app is called up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the mobile device (operating system version, model, resolution,
        language, etc.) from which you started the app,
      </li>
      <li>the IP address of the mobile device,</li>
      <li>the date and time of access,</li>
      <li>the app version used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is temporarily stored in a log file for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>error analysis,</li>
      <li>improvement of the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing is based on Art. 6
      para. 1 letter f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <h3>4.2 Required authorisations</h3>
    <p>
      In order for our app to function properly, it is necessary for you to
      allow and grant access to certain functions of your terminal device, so
      that certain data is stored on your terminal device. You will be prompted
      to grant the appropriate access authorization once at the beginning or
      when you use the respective function.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Folder in which your photos / media / files of the mobile device / USB
      memory contents are stored (read/change/delete).
    </h4>
    <p>
      If you create color pairs, they will be stored directly in the memory of
      your mobile device, depending on the installation location of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app allows you to synchronize created color pairs across all your
      devices using iCloud. You can disable syncing in the iCloud system
      settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color pairs stored on your stored device will not be transferred to us.
    </p>
    <h4>Network access &amp; connections</h4>
    <p>
      An Internet connection is only required when sending crash reports and
      usage statistics.
    </p>
    <h4>Other device functions or device sensors</h4>
    <p>
      You can send color pairs you have created to other people. A system dialog
      will appear where you can share your content (e.g. via contacts, e-mail,
      social media). A data processing by us as well as a transmission of the
      contact data to us does not take place.
    </p>
    <h4>Feedback function via e-mail</h4>
    <p>
      If you want to give us feedback, you can do so via the e-mail form within
      the app. We ask you not to send any further personal data of you or other
      persons within the feedback function to us. The legal basis for data
      processing within the framework of the feedback function is Art. 6 para. 1
      lit. a) GDPR. Your feedback messages will be deleted after 4 weeks.
    </p>
    <h4>Usage statistics</h4>
    <p>
      To improve our app, anonymized usage statistics are sent to us. The data
      collected in the process is not linked to your person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App uses the Microsoft AppCenter SDK to determine the popularity of
      suggested features (usage count) and other overall statistics (such as
      operating system version and device model) to help us better target our
      development efforts to future releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We base the data processing on our justified interest in improving the
      App. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not wish to receive statistics on the use of the App and wish to
      prevent the sending of usage statistics, you can deactivate these
      functions at any time in the App's settings using the slider (right of
      objection according to Art. 21 GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, usage statistics can be collected by the system via Apple
      Inc. This system setting is not specific to the Contrasts App and can be
      deactivated in the device settings.
    </p>
    <h4>Error reports</h4>
    <p>
      If a crash occurs in the app, anonymous crash reports (function tracing,
      operating system version, device model) are automatically collected to
      help us troubleshoot crashes in our applications. We also use the
      Microsoft AppCenter SDK for this purpose. We base the data processing on
      our legitimate interest in improving the App. The legal basis for data
      processing is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want anonymous crash reports to be sent to us via the
      Microsoft AppCenter SDK, you can deactivate these functions at any time
      using the slider in the app's settings (right of objection according to
      Art. 21 GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, system-side error reports can be collected via Apple Inc.
      This system setting is not specific to the Contrasts App and can be
      deactivated in the device settings.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Recipient of your data</h2>
    <p>
      Unless you disable this feature, the app statistics will be sent to
      Microsoft, Corp. For more information about Microsoft's privacy policy and
      the AppCenter SDK, please see:

    <h2>6. Linked websites</h2>
    <p>
      If you access websites via the in-app browser (e.g. via links), your
      personal data will be processed on these websites in deviation from this
      privacy policy. This privacy policy only applies to our App. We ask you to
      read the privacy policies of the linked websites. We are not responsible
      for the websites linked within the App and do not endorse their content.
      For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content as well as for damages
      resulting from the use or non-use of the information, the provider of the
      website to which the link was made is solely liable.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Your privacy rights</h2>
    <p>
      According to Art. 15 para. 1 GDPR you have the right to request
      information about the personal data we have stored about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, if the legal requirements are met, you have the right to
      correct (Art. 16 GDPR), delete (Art. 17 GDPR) and restrict the processing
      (Art. 18 GDPR) of your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e) or f) GDPR, you have
      the right to object under Art. 21 GDPR. If you object to data processing,
      it will not be carried out in future unless the data controller can prove
      that there are compelling reasons for further processing worthy of
      protection which outweigh the data subject's interest in objecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you yourself have provided the processed data, you have a right to data
      transfer in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR.<br />
      If the data processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1
      letter a) GDPR, you may revoke such consent at any time with effect for
      the future, without affecting the legality of the previous processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above-mentioned cases, in case of open questions or complaints,
      please contact the above-mentioned contact address in writing or by
      e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory
      authority. The data protection supervisory authority of the federal state
      in which you live or in which the person responsible is based is
      responsible.
    </p>
