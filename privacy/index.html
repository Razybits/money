# Privacy Policy

Before using Money application you are required to acquaint yourself with the Terms of Use (“Terms”) and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”). The Policy forms an integral part of the Terms and all definitions and names shall have the respective meaning defined therein. By downloading, installing, using or otherwise accessing Money application or related Razybits services, you are expressing your acceptance and willingness to be bound by the Terms, including the Policy. We refer to all of these products, together with our other services and websites as “Services” in this policy.

Our philosophy is to keep your data as private and as secure as our own data. We use Money in our daily lives, so we care a lot about our data too. We do not collect personal information. Your data stay on your device and are synced through iCloud, where only you can have access to them.

**Device and Connection Information:** We collect information about your phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access Money application. We collect information through your device about your operating system, device identifiers, and crash data. We don't use analytics services.

## Information you provide us

**App content you provide us for inspection and debugging:** If you are facing issues using our Money application, we may request you to provide us with more information about your data. Since data are stored on your device, it might happen that they can get corrupted, thus making the app behave in an unexpected or unintended way. If we do not resolve the bug or cannot reproduce it, we may request you to provide a copy of your data to test run them on our testing devices. You choose to do so or not, it is up to you. If you want to help us identify and fix your bug faster, you can send a protected copy of the requested files. Please create a password protected zip archive and send it over to us. You can send the password in a separate email after that. After receiving your data, we will anonymize by obfuscating all account names, transaction descriptions, budget names etc. Also, we will multiply the transaction amount with a randomly generated number, so that we cannot see the real value of your transaction. For example, an avocado toast costed you 10 Euros. We multiply it with a totally random number between 1 and 100, and then we get something like 19,235. So we see something like this: “hshkshghd shhs 19,235 Euro”.



## Your rights

You acknowledge that in relation to the Personal data processing you have the right to access your Personal data. If you find or presume that the Provider or any of data processors is carrying out processing of your Personal data which is in contradiction with the protection of your private and personal life or with the law, you are entitled to contact them with a complaint concerning the processing of your Personal data and ask for explanation and/or require them to remedy the arisen state of affairs, in particular by blocking (from 25. 5. 2018 “restriction of the processing”), rectification, supplementing or liquidation (from 25. 5. 2018 “erasure”) of your personal data.
You acknowledge that you have also right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing based on legitimate interest (service improvement and development), including profiling (from 25. 5. 2018).

The data deletion process has 2 phases:
– Data deletion on device & your personal cloud instance
– Data deletion manually with a request sent to us

You can delete all your historical financial data by removing the app from your device.
Or if you use multiple devices, by removing the app on all devices.

Then you can send a data deletion request and we will remove all your contact data.
